# ⚛️ React Router DOM Project

A beginner-friendly React project built to explore the basics of client-side routing using **React Router DOM**. Created as part of my journey to understand how navigation works in single-page applications.

## 🚀 What I Built

- Simple multi-page layout using `react-router-dom`
- Navigation between pages like Home, About, Contact, etc.
- Dynamic routing structure with clean URL paths
- Component-based structure with modular routing setup

## 🧭 Technologies Used

- React
- React Router DOM
- Vite (for faster development build)
- HTML & CSS

- Creating nested layouts with a shared header/footer
- Navigating between pages using `useNavigate` and `Link`
- Structuring pages and components modularly
